Lesson 109&110 A good idea
Listen to the tap then answer this question:
What does Jane have with her coffee?
Shall I make some coffee, Jane?
That's a good idea, Charlotte.
It's ready.
Do you want any milk?
Just a little, please.
What about some sugar?
Two teaspoonfuls?
No, less than that.
One and a half teaspoonfuls, please.
That's enough for me.
That was very nice.
Would you like some more?
Yes, please.
I'd like a cigarette, too.
May I have one?
Of course.
I think there are a few in that box.
I'm afraid it's empty.
What a pity!
It doesn't matter.
Have a biscuit instead.
Eat more and smoke less!
That's very good advice!
