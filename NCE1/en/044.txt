Lesson 087&88 A car crash
Listen to the tap then answer this question:
Can the mechanics repair Mr. Wood's car?
Is my car ready yet?
I don't know, sir.
What's the number of your car?
It's LFZ 312 G.
When did you bring it to us?
I brought it here three days ago.
Ah yes, I remember now.
Have your mechanics finished yet?
No, they're still working on it.
Let's go into the garage and have a look at it.
Isn't that your car?
Well, it was my car.
Didn't you have a crash?
That's right.
I drove it into a lamp-post.
Can your mechanics repair it?
Well, they're trying to repair it, sir.
But to tell you the truth, you need a new car!
