Listen to the tap then answer this question:
Why can't Pamela type the letter?
Can you come here a minute please, Bob?
Yes, sir?
Where's Pamela?
She's next door.
She's in her office, sir.
Can she type this letter for me?
Ask her please.
Yes, sir.
Can you type this letter for the boss please, Pamela?
Yes, of course I can.
Here you are.
Thank you, Bob.
Bob!
Yes?
What's the matter?
I can't type this letter.
I can't read it!
The boss's handwriting is terrible!
