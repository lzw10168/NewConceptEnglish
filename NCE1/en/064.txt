Lesson 127&128 A famous actress
Listen to the tap then answer this question:
Who is only twenty-nine, and why is it so unclear?
Can you recognize that woman, Liz?
I think I can, Kate.
It must be Karen Marsh, the actress.
I thought so.
Who's that beside her?
That must be Conrad Reeves.
Conrad Reeves, the actor?
It can't be.
Let me have another look.
I think you're right!
Isn't he her third husband?
No.
He must be her fourth or fifth.
Doesn't Karen Marsh look old!
She does, doesn't she!
I read she's twenty-nine, but she must be at least forty.
I'm sure she is.
She was a famous actress when I was still at school.
That was a long time ago, wasn't it?
Not that long ago!
I'm not more than twenty-nine myself.
