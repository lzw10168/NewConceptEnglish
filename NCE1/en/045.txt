Lesson 089&90 For sale
Listen to the tap then answer this question:
Why couldn't Nigel decide?
Good afternoon.
I believe that this house is for sale.
That's right.
May I have a look at it, please?
Yes, of course.
Come in.
How long have you lived here?
I've lived here for twenty years.
Twenty years!
That's a long time.
Yes, I've been here since 1976.
Then why do you want to sell it?
Because I've just retired.
I want to buy a small house in the country.
How much does this house cost?
Â£68,500.
That's a lot of money!
It's worth every penny of it.
Well, I like the house, but I can't decide yet.
My wife must see it first.
Women always have the last word.
