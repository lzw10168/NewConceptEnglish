Lesson 123&124 A trip to Australia
First listen and then answer the question:
Who is the man with the beard?
Look, Scott.
This is a photograph I took during my trip to Australia.
Let me see it, Mike.
This is a good photograph.
Who are these people?
They're people I met during the trip.
That's the ship we travelled on.
What a beautiful ship!
Who's this?
That's the man I told you about.
Remember?
Ah yes.
The one who offered you a job in Australia.
That's right.
Who's this?
Guess!
It's not you, is it?
That's right.
I grew a beard during the trip, but I shaved it off when I came home.
Why did you shave it off?
My wife didn't like it!
