Lesson 097&98 A small blue case
Listen to the tap then answer this question:
Does Mr. Hall get his case back?
I left a suitcase on the train to London the other day.
Can you describe it, sir?
It's a small blue case and it's got a zip.
There's a label on the handle with my name and address on it.
Is this case yours?
No, that's not mine.
What about this one?
This one's got a label.
Let me see it.
What's your name and address?
David Hall, 83, Bridge Street.
That's right.
D. N. Hall, 83, Bridge Street.
Three pounds fifty pence, please.
Here you are.
Thank you.
Hey!
What's the matter?
This case doesn't belong to me!
You've given me the wrong case!
