Lesson 111&112 The most expensive model
Listen to the tap then answer this question:
Can Mr. Frith buy the television on instalments? How does it work?
I like this television very much.
How much does it cost?
It's the most expensive model in the shop.
It costs five hundred pounds.
That's too expensive for us.
We can't afford all that money.
This model's less expensive than that one.
It's only three hundred pounds.
But, of course, it's not as good as the expensive one.
I don't like this model.
The other model's more expensive, but it's worth the money.
Can we buy it on instalments?
Of course.
You can pay a deposit of thirty pounds, and then fourteen pounds a month for three years.
Do you like it, dear?
I certainly do, but I don't like the price.
You always want the best, but we can't afford it.
Sometimes you think you're a millionaire!
Millionaires don't buy things on instalments!
