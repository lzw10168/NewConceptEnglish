Lesson 113&114 Small change
Listen to the tap then answer this question:
Who has got some small change?
Fares, please!
Trafalgar Square, please.
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't change a ten-pound note.
Haven't you got any small change?
I've got no small change, I am afraid.
I'll ask some of the passengers.
Have you any small change, sir?
I'm sorry.
I've got none.
I haven't got any either.
Can you change this ten-pound note, madam?
I'm afraid I can't.
Neither can I.
I'm very sorry, sir.
You must get off the bus.
None of our passengers can change this note.
They're all millionaires!
Except us.
I've got some small change.
So have I.
