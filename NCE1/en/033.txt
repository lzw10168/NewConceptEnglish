Lesson 065&66 Not a baby
First listen and then answer the question:
Does Jill take the key to the front door?
What are you going to do this evening, Jill?
I'm going to meet some friends, Dad.
You mustn't come home late.
You must be home at half past ten.
I can't get home so early, Dad!
Can I have the key to the front door, please?
No, you can't.
Jill's eighteen years old, Tom.
She's not a baby.
Give her the key.
She always comes home early.
Oh, all right!
Here you are.
But you mustn't come home after a quarter past eleven.
Do you hear?
Yes, Dad.
Thanks, Mum.
That's all right.
Goodbye.
Enjoy yourself!
We always enjoy ourselves, Mum.
Bye-bye.
