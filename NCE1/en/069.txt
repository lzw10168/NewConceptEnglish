Lesson 137&138 A pleasant dream
Listen to the tap then answer this question:
What would Julie like to do, if she had the money?
Are you doing the football pools, Brain?
Yes, I've nearly finished, Julie.
I'm sure we'll win something this week.
You always say that, but we never win anything!
What will you do if you win a lot of money?
If I win a lot of money I'll buy you a mink coat.
I don't want a mink coat!
I want to see the world.
All right.
If we win a lot of money we'll travel round the world and we'll stay at the best hotels.
Then we'll return home and buy a big house in the country.
We'll have a beautiful garden and...
But if we spend all that money we'll be poor again.
What'll we do then?
If we spend all the money we'll try and win the football pools again.
It's a pleasant dream but everything depends on 'if' !
