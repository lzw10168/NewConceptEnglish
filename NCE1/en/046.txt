Lesson 091&92 Poor Ian!
First listen and then answer the question:
Who wanted to sell the house?
Has Ian sold his house yet?
Yes, he has.
He sold it last week.
Has he moved to his new house yet?
No, not yet.
He's still here.
He's going to move tomorrow.
When? Tomorrow morning?
No. Tomorrow afternoon.
I'll miss him.
He has always been a good neighbour.
He's a very nice person.
We'll all miss him.
When will the new people move into this house?
I think that they'll move in the day after tomorrow.
Will you see Ian today, Jenny?
Yes, I will.
Please give him my regards.
Poor Ian! He didn't want to leave this house.
No, he didn't want to leave, but his wife did!
