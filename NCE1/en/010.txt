Lesson 19&20 Tired and thirsty
Listen to the tap then answer this question:
Why do the children thank their mother?
What’s the matter, children?
We are tired ...
... and thirsty, Mum.
Sit down here.
Are you all right now?
No, we aren’t.
Look!
There’s an ice cream man.
Two ice creams please.
Here you are, children.
Thanks, Mum.
These ice creams are nice.
Are you all right now?
Yes, we are, thank you.
