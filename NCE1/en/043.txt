Lesson 085&86 Paris in the spring
Listen to the tap then answer this question:
At what time of year did Ken visit Paris?
Hello, Ken.
Hi, George.
Have you just been to the cinema?
Yes, I have.
What's on?
'Paris in the Spring'.
Oh, I've already seen it.
I saw it on television last year.
It's an old film, but it's very good.
Paris is a beautiful city.
I've never been there.
Have you ever been there, Ken?
Yes, I have.
I was there in April.
Paris in the spring, eh?
It was spring, but the weather was awful.
It rained all the time.
Just like London!
