Lesson 129&130 Seventy miles an hour
Listen to the tap then answer this question:
What does Ann advise her husband to do next time?
Look, Gary!
That policeman's waving to you.
He wants you to stop.
Where do you think you are?
On a race track?
You must have been driving at seventy miles an hour.
I can't have been.
I was doing eighty when I overtook you.
Didn't you see the speed limit?
I'm afraid I didn't, officer.
I must have been dreaming.
He wasn't dreaming, officer.
I was telling him to drive slowly.
That's why I didn't see the sign.
Let me see your driving licence.
I won't charge you this time.
But you'd better not do it again!
Thank you.
I'll certainly be more careful.
I told you to drive slowly, Gary.
You always tell me to drive slowly, darling.
Well, next time you'd better take my advice!
