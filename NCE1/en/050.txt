Lesson 099&100 Ow!
First listen and then answer the question:
Must Andy go to see the doctor?
Ow!
What's the matter, Andy?
I slipped and fell downstairs.
Have you hurt yourself?
Yes, I have.
I think that I've hurt my back.
Try and stand up.
Can you stand up?
Here. Let me help you.
I'm sorry, Lucy.
I'm afraid that I can't get up.
I think that the doctor had better see you.
I'll phone Dr. Carter.
The doctor says that he will come at once.
I'm sure that you need an X-ray, Andy.
