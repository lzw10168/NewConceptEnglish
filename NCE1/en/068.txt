Is Karen Marsh going to retire, do you think?
Are you really going to retire, Miss Marsh?
I may.
I can't make up my mind.
I will have to ask my future husband.
He won't let me make another film.
Your future husband, Miss Marsh?
Yes.
Let me introduce him to you.
His name is Carlos.
We're going to get married next week.
Look, Liz!
