Lesson 037&38 Making a bookcase
First listen and then answer the question:
What is Susan's favourite colour?
You're working hard, George.
What are you doing?
I'm making a bookcase.
Give me that hammer please, Dan.
Which hammer?
This one?
No, not that one.
The big one.
Here you are.
Thanks, Dan.
What are you going to do now, George?
I'm going to paint it.
What colour are you going to paint it?
I'm going to paint it pink.
Pink!
This bookcase isn't for me.
It's for my daughter, Susan.
Pink's her favourite colour.
