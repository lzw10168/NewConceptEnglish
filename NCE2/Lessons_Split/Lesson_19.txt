【Text】 
'The play may begin at any moment,' I said. 
'It may have begun already,' Susan answered. 
I hurried to the ticket office. 'May I have two tickets please?' I asked. 
'I'm sorry, we've sold out,' the girl said. 
'What a pity!' Susan exclaimed. 
Just then, a man hurried to the ticket office. 
'Can I return these two tickets?' he asked. 
'Certainly,' the girl said. 
I went back to the ticket office at once. 
'Could I have those two tickets please?' I asked. 
'Certainly,' the girl said, 'but they're for next Wednesday's performance. Do you still want them?' 'I might as well have them,' I said sadly. 
 
参考译文 “剧马上就要开演了, “我说. “也许已经开演了呢, “苏珊回答说. 
我匆匆赶到售票处, 问 : “我可以买两张票吗?” “对不起, 票已售完. “那位姑娘说. 
“真可惜!” 苏珊大声说. 正在这时, 一个男子匆匆奔向售票处. 
“我可以退掉这两张票吗?” 他问. 
“当然可以, “那姑娘说. 我马上又回到售票处. “我可以买那两张票吗?” 我问. 
“当然可以, 不过这两张票是下星期三的, 您是否还要呢?” “我还是买下的好, “我垂头丧气地说.
