【Text】 
My daughter, Jane, never dreamed of receiving a letter from a girl of her own age in Holland. Last year, we were travelling across the Channel and Jane put a piece of paper with her name and address on it into a bottle. She threw the bottle into the sea. She never thought of it again, but ten months later, she received a letter from a girl in Holland. Both girls write to each other regularly now. However, they have decided to use the post office. Letters will cost a little more, but they will certainly travel faster. 
 
参考译文我的女儿简从未想过会接到荷兰一位同龄姑娘的来信. 去年, 当我们横渡英吉利海峡时, 简把写有她姓
名和住址的一张纸条装进了一只瓶子, 又将瓶子扔进了大海. 此后她就再没去想那只瓶子. 但 10 个月以后, 她收到了荷兰一位姑娘的来信. 现在这两位姑娘定期通信了. 然而她们还是决定利用邮局. 这样会稍微多花点钱, 但肯定是快得多了.
