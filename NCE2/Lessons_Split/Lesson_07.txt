【Text】 
The plane was late and detectives were waiting at the airport all morning. They were expecting a valuable parcel of diamonds from South Africa. A few hours earlier, someone had told the police that thieves would try to steal the diamonds. When the plane arrived, some of the detectives were waiting inside the main building while others were waiting on the airfield. Two men took the parcel off the plane and carried it into the Customs House. While two detectives were keeping guard at the door, two others opened the parcel. To their surprise, the precious parcel was full of stones and sand! 
 
参考译文 
飞机误点了, 侦探们在机场等了整整一上午. 他们正期待从南非来的一个装着钻石的贵重包裹. 数小时以前, 有人向警方报告, 说有人企图偷走这些钻石. 当飞机到达时, 一些侦探等候在主楼内, 另一些侦探则守候在停机坪上. 有两个人把包裹拿下飞机, 进了海关. 这时两个侦探把住门口, 另外两个侦探打开了包裹. 令他们吃惊的是, 那珍贵的包裹里面装的全是石头和沙子! 
 
【课文讲解】 
1、	The plane was late and detectives were waiting at the airport all morning. 
all 一般直接加表示时间的单数名词构成副词短语，如：all day，all night，all week，all winter，all year 
等。但不说 all hour。 
whole 在表达同样的意思时一般要加冠词或数词，如 a whole day/year，two whole weeks。 all morning=all the morning 
 
The plane was late 飞机晚(点)了 
The bus was late./The train was late. 
detectives 没有强调一些侦探或者那些侦探, 强调侦探这种人，笼统感念, 可不加 some, the 
 
2、	They were expecting a valuable parcel of diamonds from South Africa. 
a valuable parcel of diamonds 
a cup of tea 强调的是茶 
South Africa 南非 
 
3、A few hours earlier, someone had told the police that thieves would try to steal the diamonds. a few hours earlier 几个小时以前 
= a few hours before/a few hours ago 
would +do 过去将来时,间接方式, 转述, 站在过去看未来 
 
4、	When the plane arrived, some of the detectives were waiting inside the main building while 
 others were waiting on the airfield. 
代词 others 常常和 some 连用，表示“有些（人）……，也有些（人）……”或“有的……，其余的……” one…the other… 一个……另一个…… some…others… 	一些……另一些…… 
Some students are very hard-working, others are not. others=other+名词复数 
 
5、	Two men took the parcel off the plane and carried it into the Customs House. 
take sth. off…=take sth. away from… and carried it into…carried 表示看得很重 
Customs House  海关 
 
6、	While two detectives were keeping guard at the door, two others opened the parcel. To their surprise, the precious parcel was full of stones and sand! 
…were keeping guard at the door, two others opened the parcel. 
表面上是分工, 两个动作同时发生, 不是同时开始同时结束, 延续时间不一致, 长一点时间的动作用进 
行时态, 短时间的动作用过去时. 
When someone knocked at the door, I was having dinner. 
keep guard 守卫 
They kept a close guard over the thieves. 
at the door 在门边(固定搭配) two others=two other detectives 
 
to one's surprise,让某人惊讶的是 
To my surprise, the teacher was late. 
To one’s +表达人情绪的名词
to one's joy 
To my joy, my mother came here yesterday. 
to one's excitement To our excitement, our team wins. 
 
be full of ...装满 
My bag was full of books. 
The cup is full of water. 
 
【Key structures】 	 过去进行时 
过去进行时的构成：be 的过去式+现在分词过去进行时和一般过去时经常同在一个句子里使用。过去进行时表示过去正在进行的动作或情况，一  般过去时则表示比较短暂的动作或事件。正在进行中的动作或情况往往由连词 when，while，as，just as 等引导。 
when，while 当……时候（强调动作同时发生） while+从句, 动词一定是延续性动词 when+延续性动词/瞬间动词 while 能用 when 代替，但是 when 却不一定能用 while 代替。while 通常只引导持续时间较长的动作， 
并且主句和从句可以同时用过去进行时，而 when 和as 一般不这么用。 
John was watching TV while his wife was talking with a neighbour over the phone. Just as I was leaving the house, you came in. when 也可以引导比较短暂的动作，while 和 as 则一般不行。 
We were having supper when the lights went out. 
过去进行时往往与表示一段时间的状语连用，如 all morning，all night，all day，all evening，the whole week 等，表示这段时间一直在干什么。 
What were you doing all evening? I couldn’t find you anywhere. 
 
过去动作同时发生的时态 
① 过去两个动作同时发生, 习惯上一个用一般过去时, 另一个用过去进行时；动作长用过去进行时, 动作短用一般过去时; 分工的情况, 动作的开始时间和结束时间几乎相同, 均用过去进行时; 
I was listening to the radio, my sister was dancing. 
When my mother was doing the housework, my father was watching TV. 
②	两个动作在同时段进行, 在不同时间结束, 先发生的动作未结束, 另一个动作发生, 先发生的动作用进行时态, 另一个动作用过去时. 
When I was opening the door, the telephone rang. 先 开 门 
When the telephone was ringing, I opened the door. 电话先响 
③	瞬间动词（如：arrive）没有进行时态, 所以两个动作同时发生, 延续性动词用进行时态, 瞬间动词使用过去时态. 
When he arrived, I was having dinner. 
I am arriving 进行时态表示将要 
 
Exercises D 
1 As my father ______ (leave) the house, the postman _______ (arrive). 
was leaving；arrived(两个瞬间动词同时发生可能性很小, 应具体分析, 故用进行时态表将来) 
5   While mother ______ (prepare) lunch, Janet ______ (set) the table. 
set the table 摆桌子 was preparing；set 
 
【Special Difficulties】 
短语动词中的小品词 
许多动词加上介词或副词后就会改变词义，这些介词和副词通常被称为小品词。它们没有词形的变化。  有
些小品词既可以作介词又可以作副词。判断一个小品词是副词还是介词要看小品词有没有带宾语。有宾   语的是介词，没有宾语的是副词，介词的位置相对固定，不能变动。 
① vi.&vt.+ prep./adv.+宾语(n.) She is walking up the hill. ② vt.+宾语(n./pron.)+adv. 
take off the coat =take the coat off =take it off put on your shoes =put your shoes on =put them on 
I always take money with me.我身上总带些钱 
 
Exercise 
11 They have pulled down the old building. 
pull down… （pull<vt.>；down<adv.>） pull one's leg 开玩笑 
You are pulling my leg.你开我玩笑 12 Make up your mind. 
make up…--->make up one's mind 习惯用法不换,语法上可换 
13 He asked for permission to leave. 
ask for…-->ask (sb.) for sth. 其实是省略 sb.故不可换
