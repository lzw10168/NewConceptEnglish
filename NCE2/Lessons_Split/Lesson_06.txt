【Text】 
I have just moved to a house in Bridge Street. Yesterday a beggar knocked at my door. He asked me for a meal and a glass of beer. In return for this, the beggar stood on his head and sang songs. I gave him a meal. He ate the food and drank the beer. Then he put a piece of cheese in his pocket and went away. Later a neighbour told me about him. Everybody knows him. His name is Percy Buttons. He calls at every house in the street once a month and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer.

【Key structures】 
A, The and Some 
当表示不确定的某个人或物时，用不定冠词 a/an（单数,  可数名词）；当表示不可数的名词时，则需要由不定冠词加量词组成词组。 
 
在表示一种笼统概念（某某一类/一种东西）的陈述句中可以省略 a 和 some 
A tiger is a dangerous animal. 
Tigers are dangerous. 
Salt is necessary for/to us all. 
表示某个确定的人或事物或者上文已提到过的人或事物， 则要用定冠词 the （ 有时相当于 this/that/these/those）,可数名词单/复数或不可数名词均可。在姓名、地名、国名（非复合词）以及月份、星期等前面不加任何冠词。 
a 和 the 的区别：a 是泛指, a man；特指, the man 
在文章当中第一次出现名词的时候往往用 a 和 an 修饰, 第二次出现的时候用the 
A man is walking towards me. The man is carrying a parcel. The parcel is full of meat. 
I have just drunk a glass of milk. Milk is very refreshing. 
I ate an apple. Apples are delicious.
