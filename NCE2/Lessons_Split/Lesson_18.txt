'Did you have a good meal?" he asked. 
'Yes, thank you,' I answered, 'but I can't pay the bill. I haven't got my bag.'

【Key structures】 
have 的用法 
1、	have 作为助动词构成各种完成时和完成进行时 
2、	have 还可以作完全动词，当作“具有、拥有”讲时，它和 have got 通常可以互换。have 做 “有, 患病” 概念时, 可作为实义动词, 也可作为非实义动词。在英国英语中的疑问句和否定句中 have（具有）的用法与 be 相同，即可以不用助动词 do 或 did；在美国英语中，常用 do 助动词和 have 一起构成疑问句  和否定句。 
I don’t have a pen/a headache. I haven’t a pen /a headache. 
三种情况 have 可以用 have got 取代 
I have a pen. I have got a pen. “有” 
I have a headache. I have got a headache. “得病” have to== have got to 
have 作“具有，拥有”讲时是状态动词，不能用于进行时态或被动语态，通常用于一般现在时。在其它时态中，一般用 have 而不用 have got。 
You can have these apples if you want them. I’ve got a lot more. 如果你想要这些苹果你可以把它们拿走。我还有许多。 
He must be very fond of animals to have five dogs. 他一定非常喜欢动物，才会养五条狗。 
3、	have 作完全动词时，还可以表示 eat，drink，enjoy，take 等意思，这时它是行为动词，可以用于包括进行时的各种时态。当 have 用于表示这些含义时，它必须与助动词 do 等连用以构成疑问句或否定句。 have dinner，have a cigarette，have coffee，have a holiday，have a good time，have a swim，have a rest
