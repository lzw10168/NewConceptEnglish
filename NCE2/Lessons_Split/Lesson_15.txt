【Text】 
The secretary told me that Mr. Harmsworth would see me. I felt very nervous when I went into his office. He did not look up from his desk when I entered. After I had sat down, he said that business was very bad. He told me that the firm could not afford to pay such large salaries. Twenty people had already left. I knew that my turn had come. 
'Mr.Harmsworth,' I said in a weak voice. 
'Don't interrupt,' he said. Then he smiled and told me I would receive an extra thousand pounds a year!

【Key structures】 	 
间接引语 
把某人所说的话告诉另外一个人时，应该使用间接引语。间接陈述句的时态往往受引述动词的影响。引述陈述句时最常用的动词是 say 和 tell，tell 后面必须跟表示人称的间接宾语（tell sb.），而 say 后面则可跟或不跟 to+讲话对象。 
1、主从一致 : 主句和从句的时态一致 
①	主句的动词为一般现在时, 从句为任意时态 
②	主句的动词为一般过去时, 从句为相对应的过去时态（时态倒移） 
一般现在时——>   一般过去时 	现在进行时——> 过去进行时 
现在完成时——>   过去完成时 	将来完成时——> 过去将来完成时
一般过去时——> 过去完成时 2、人称变化：主要是第一和第二人称变化 
3、只要属于宾语从句, 引导词 that 可以省略
