【Text】 
I was having dinner at a restaurant when Tony Steele came in. Tony worked in a lawyer's office years ago, but he is now working at a bank. He gets a good salary, but he always borrows money from his friends and never pays it back. Tony saw me and came and sat at the same table. He has never borrowed money from me. While he was eating, I asked him to lend me twenty pounds. To my surprise, he gave me the money immediately. 'I have never borrowed any money from you,' Tony said, 'so now you can pay for my dinner!' 
 
参考译文 
我正在一家饭馆吃饭, 托尼.斯蒂尔走了进来. 托尼曾在一家律师事务所工作, 而现在正在一家银行上班. 他的薪水很高, 但他却总是向朋友借钱, 并且从来不还. 托尼看见了我, 就走过来和我坐到一张桌子前. 他从未向我借过钱. 当他吃饭时, 我提出向他借 20 英镑. 令我惊奇的是, 他立刻把钱给了我. “我还从未向你借过钱, “托尼说道, “所以现在你可以替我付饭钱了!” 
 
【课文讲解】 
1、	One good turn deserves another 礼尚往来, 善有善报 one bad turn deserves another 恶有恶报 
 
2、	Tony worked in a lawyer's office years ago, but he is now working at a bank. 
work for… 	强调工作 work in… 	强调 in 后面的地点

(some/several) years ago 名词-s,前面省略了 some 
 
3、	He gets a good salary, but he always borrows money from his friends and never pays it back. The teachers in the New Oriental school can get a good salary. borrow sth. from sb. 	从……借…… never=not 前面不需要加助动词 
pay 在这里的意思是“偿还（债务等）”，还可解释为“付，支付（价款、账单）等”。Pay 既是及物动 
词也可以是不及物动词。 
How much did you pay for that dress?

never pays it back 从不归还

【Special Difficulties】 
动词+名词/代词+带 to 的不定式 
某些动词之后的带 to 的不定式之前可以有一个名词或代词。有些动词后的名词/代词可有可无，但有和 
没有经常影响影响整个句子的意义。 
I asked him to lend me twenty pounds. 
I want to speak to John. 
I want you to speak to John. Would you like to do sth.? 
I’d like sb. to do sth. I’d like to do sth. 
还有一些动词后面用不定式作宾语时，其后通常必须有一名词或代词。这类动词有 allow，advise，help， 
teach，tell，request 等，这类动词不但可用于主动语态，也可用于被动语态： 
We were not allowed to see the picture. 
 
hope 一定不能说 hope sb. to do sth.，正确用法是 hope to do (希望自己)或 hope that(希望别人)
