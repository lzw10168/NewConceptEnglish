[00:00:000] Lesson 96 The dead return
[00:06:310] First listen and then answer the question:
[00:11:200] What happens to the lanterns at the end of the festival?
[00:14:720] A Festival for the Dead is held once a year in Japan.
[00:22:460] This festival is a cheerful occasion, for on this day, the dead are said to return to their homes and they are welcomed by the living.
[00:27:920] As they are expected to be hungry after their long journey, food is laid out for them.
[00:42:140] Specially-made lanterns are hung outside each house to help the dead to find their way.
[00:49:660] All night long, people dance and sing.
[00:54:580] In the early morning, the food that had been laid out for the dead is thrown into a river or into the sea as it is considered unlucky for anyone living to eat it.
[01:09:620] In towns that are near the sea, the tiny lanterns which had been hung in the streets the night before, are placed into the water when the festival is over.
[01:22:220] Thousands of lanterns slowly drift out to sea guiding the dead on their return journey to the other world.
[01:31:640] This is a moving spectacle, for crowds of people stand on the shore watching the lanterns drifting away until they can be seen no more.
