[00:00:000] Lesson 4 An exciting trip
[00:04:800] First listen and then answer the question:
[00:10:060] Why is Tim finding this trip exciting?
[00:16:200] I have just received a letter from my brother, Tim.
[00:21:640] He is in Australia. He has been there for six months.
[00:26:600] Tim is an engineer. He is working for a big firm and he has already visited a great number of different places in Australia.
[00:36:820] He has just bought an Australian car and has gone to Alice Springs, a small town in the centre of Australia.
[00:47:740] He will soon visit Darwin. From there, he will fly to Perth.
[00:54:160] My brother has never been abroad before, so he is finding this trip very exciting.
