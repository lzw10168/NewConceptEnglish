[00:00:000] Lesson 5 No wrong numbers
[00:05:520] First listen and then answer the question:
[00:10:580] What does 'No wrong numbers' mean?
[00:15:940] Mr. James Scott has a garage in Silbury and now he has just bought another garage in Pinhurst.
[00:24:680] Pinhurst is only five miles from Silbury, but Mr. Scott cannot get a telephone for his new garage, so he has just bought twelve pigeons.
[00:38:940] Yesterday, a pigeon carried the first message from Pinhurst to Silbury.
[00:45:840] The bird covered the distance in three minutes.
[00:49:980] Up to now, Mr. Scott has sent a great many requests for spare parts and other urgent messages from one garage to the other.
[01:01:340] In this way, he has begun his own private 'telephone' service.
