[00:00:000] Lesson 16 A polite request
[00:05:560] First listen and then answer the question:
[00:10:100] What was the polite request?
[00:14:920] If you park your car in the wrong place, a traffic policeman will soon find it.
[00:15:420] You will be very lucky if he lets you go without a ticket.
[00:26:840] However, this does not always happen. Traffic police are sometimes very polite.
[00:36:020] During a holiday in Sweden, I found this note on my car:
[00:42:180] 'sir, we welcome you to our city. This is a "No Parking" area. You will enjoy your stay here if you pay attention to our street signs. This note is only a reminder.'
[00:44:260] If you receive a request like this, you cannot fail to obey it!
