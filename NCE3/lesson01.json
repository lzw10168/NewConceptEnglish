      "dialogue": [
        "When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.",
        "The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered.",
        "The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes.",
        "Several people complained of 'cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt for the puma continued for several weeks, but the puma was not caught.",
        "It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside."

        "当伦敦动物园接到报告说，在伦敦以南45英里处发现了一只野生美洲狮时，这些报告并没有被当真。然而，随着证据的逐渐积累，动物园的专家们感到有必要进行调查，因为声称看到美洲狮的人们所描述的特征非常相似。",
        "对美洲狮的搜寻从一个小村庄开始，那里一位正在采摘黑莓的妇女看到'一只大猫'，离她只有5码远。当她看到它时，它立即逃走了，专家们证实，美洲狮除非被逼到绝境，否则不会攻击人类。",
        "搜寻工作很困难，因为常常是早晨在一个地方看到这只美洲狮，晚上却在20英里外的另一个地方发现它。无论它走到哪里，都会留下一串死鹿和兔子之类的小动物。在许多地方都发现了爪印，灌木丛中发现了粘在上面的美洲狮毛。",
        "几个人抱怨夜里听到'像猫一样的叫声'，一位去钓鱼的商人看见那只美洲狮在树上。专家们现在完全确信那动物就是美洲狮，但它是从哪里来的呢？由于全国动物园没有关于美洲狮丢失的报告，这只美洲狮一定是私人收藏的，不知怎么设法逃脱了。对美洲狮的搜寻持续了几个星期，但始终未能捉到它。",
        "想到在宁静的乡村里仍有一头危险的野兽在逍遥法外，真令人担忧。"
