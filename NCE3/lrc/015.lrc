[00:00:000] Lesson 15 Fifty pence worth of trouble
[00:06:220] Listen to the tap then answer the question below:
[00:10:280] Did George get anything for his fifty pence? What?
[00:16:740] Children always appreciate small gifts of money.
[00:20:740] Mum or dad, of course, provide a regular supply of pocket money, but uncles and aunts are always a source of extra income.
[00:31:100] With some children, small sums go a long way.
[00:35:600] If fifty pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets, they rattle for months inside money boxes.
[00:43:300] Only very thrifty children manage to fill up a money box.
[00:48:400] For most of them, fifty pence is a small price to pay for a nice big bar of chocolate.
[00:57:220] My nephew, George, has a money box but it is always empty.
[01:02:500] Very few of the fifty pence pieces and pound coins I have given him have found their way there.
[01:10:220] I gave him fifty pence yesterday and advised him to save it. Instead he bought himself fifty pence worth of trouble.
[01:19:760] On his way to the sweet shop, he dropped his fifty pence and it bounced along the pavement and then disappeared down a drain.
[01:29:960] George took off his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and pushed his right arm through the drain cover.
[01:37:720] He could not find his fifty pence piece anywhere, and what is more, he could not get his arm out.
[01:46:100] A crowd of people gathered round him and a lady rubbed his arm with soap and butter, but George was firmly stuck.
[01:55:660] The fire brigade was called and two fire fighters freed George using a special type of grease.
[01:59:000] George was not too upset by his experience because the lady who owns the sweet shop heard about his troubles and rewarded him with a large box of chocolates.
