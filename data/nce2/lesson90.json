      "因此，听说北海石油钻井平台上的潜水员受到巨型鱼类的恐吓，确实很让人吃惊。",
      "钻井平台需要经常修理。",
      "潜水员常常要在水面100英尺以下摸黑工作。",
      "他们曾在工作时被撞到他们身上的大鱼吓得惊惶失措。",
      "现在他们有了特制的笼子。",
      "这些笼子用来保护他们免受大鱼的侵袭。",
      "这些鱼并不是鲨鱼或逆戟鲸。",
      "它们是深受人们喜爱的食用鱼品种，如鳕鱼和鳐鱼。",
      "只不过它们长得出奇地大。",
      "有时长达12英尺。",
      "这些鱼能长得这么大是由3个因素造成的。",
      "第一个因素是海底热的输油管道附近的温暖的海水。",
      "第二个因素是钻井平台工作人员抛到海里充足的食物。",
      "第三个因素是钻井平台周围根本没有捕鱼船只。",
      "结果是，这些鱼就在可爱的温暖的水流中吃呀吃，长呀长。",
