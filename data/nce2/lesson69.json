  "editorNotes": "本课讲述了一个驾驶考试的故事。主人公在第三次参加驾驶执照考试时，虽然前面的表现很好，但在最后的紧急情况测试中反应太慢，导致'撞死'了一个假设突然横穿马路的小孩。文章通过这个生动的故事，展示了被动语态的各种用法，特别是'介词+动名词'结构中的被动语态，以及一些表示'练习'和'娱乐'的动词的区别。文章还展示了如何表达对过去事情的猜测，以及一些常见的英语表达方式。",

      "I was being tested for a driving licence for the third time.",
      "I had been asked to drive in heavy traffic and had done so successfully.",
      "After having been instructed to drive out of town, I began to acquire confidence.",
      "Sure that I had passed, I was almost beginning to enjoy my test.",
      "The examiner must have been pleased with my performance, for he smiled and said, 'Just one more thing, Mr. Eames. Let us suppose that a child suddenly crosses the road in front of you. As soon as I tap on the window, you must stop within five feet.'",
      "I continued driving and after some time, the examiner tapped loudly.",
      "Though the sound could be heard clearly, it took me a long time to react.",
      "I suddenly pressed the brake pedal and we were both thrown forward.",
      "The examiner looked at me sadly.",
