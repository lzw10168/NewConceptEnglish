  "editorNotes": "本课讲述了一个关于政治选举后的幽默故事。前首相温特沃兹·莱恩在大选中被击败后退出政界并移居国外，而帕特里克作为莱恩激进党的反对者，连续三天到前首相的住处询问同样的问题，只是为了听警察重复莱恩已经失败并离开的消息。本课介绍了多个与政治相关的词汇，如election、former、defeat、opponent等，以及一些常用短语如lose one's temper、in a good/bad mood等。本课还介绍了ex-前缀的用法，以及temper和mood的区别。",

      "When he asked if Mr. Lane lived there, the policeman on duty told him that since his defeat, the ex-Prime Minister had gone abroad.",
      "On the following day, Patrick went to the house again.",
      "The same policeman was just walking slowly past the entrance, when Patrick asked the same question.",
      "Though a little suspicious this time, the policeman gave him the same answer.",
      "The day after, Patrick went to the house once more and asked exactly the same question.",
      "This time, the policeman lost his temper.",

        "title": "文化背景",
        "content": "在英国的政治体系中，首相（Prime Minister）是政府的首脑，通常由在大选中获胜的政党的领袖担任。大选（general election）是英国政治生活中的重要事件，通常每五年举行一次，但首相也可以提前宣布举行大选。\n\n在大选中，各个政党的候选人会在全国各地的选区（constituency）中竞争议会议员（Member of Parliament，简称MP）的席位。获得最多议席的政党通常能够组建政府，该党的领袖则成为首相。\n\n本课中提到的'激进进步党'（Radical Progressive Party）是一个虚构的政党，但在英国历史上确实存在过一些带有'激进'（Radical）或'进步'（Progressive）标签的政治团体。例如，19世纪的'激进派'（Radicals）是一群主张政治改革的人，而20世纪初的'进步联盟'（Progressive Alliance）则是由自由党和工党组成的政治联盟。\n\n在英国政治中，政党之间的竞争非常激烈，支持者可能会对对手表现出强烈的反对情绪，就像课文中帕特里克对莱恩先生的激进党的态度一样。然而，帕特里克的行为也反映了政治竞争中的一种幽默感，他通过反复询问同样的问题来表达自己对政治对手失败的喜悦。"
