      "It must have been about two in the morning when I returned home.",
      "I tried to wake up my wife by ringing the doorbell, but she was fast asleep, so I got a ladder from the shed in the garden, put it against the wall, and began climbing towards the bedroom window.",
      "I was almost there when a sarcastic voice below said, 'I don't think the windows need cleaning at this time of the night.'",
      "I looked down and nearly fell off the ladder when I saw a policeman.",
      "I immediately regretted answering in the way I did, but I said, 'I enjoy cleaning windows at night.'",
      "'So do I,' answered the policeman in the same tone.",
      "'Excuse my interrupting you. I hate to interrupt a man when he's busy working, but would you mind coming with me to the station?'",
      "'Well, I'd prefer to stay here,' I said. 'You see. I've forgotten my key.'",
      "'Your what?' he called.",
      "'My key,' I shouted.",
      "Fortunately, the shouting woke up my wife who opened the window just as the policeman had started to climb towards me."

      "我回到家时，肯定已是凌晨两点左右了。",
      "我按响了门铃，试图唤醒我的妻子，但她睡得很熟。于是，我从花园的小棚里搬来了一个梯子，把它靠在墙边，开始向卧室的窗口爬去。",
      "快要爬到窗口时，下面一个人用讽刺的口吻说：\"我看不必在夜里这个时候擦窗子吧。\"",
      "我向下面看去。当我看清是一个警察时，差一点儿从梯子上掉下去。",
      "我回答了他的话，但马上又后悔不该那样说，我是这样说的：\"我喜欢在夜里擦窗子。\"",
      "\"我也是的，\"警察用同样的声调回答，",
      "\"请原谅我打断了您。当一个人在忙着干活时，我是不愿意去打断他的，但请您跟我到警察局去一趟好吗？\"",
      "\"可我更愿意呆在这儿，\"我说，\"您瞧，我忘带钥匙了。\"",
      "\"什么？\"他大声问。",
      "\"钥匙！\"我喊道。",
      "幸运得很，这喊声惊醒了我的妻子。就在警察开始向我爬上来时，她打开了窗子。"
