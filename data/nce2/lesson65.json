  "editorNotes": "本课讲述了一个有趣的圣诞节故事。马戏团老板吉米·盖茨为了给儿童医院送礼物，打扮成圣诞老人，骑着小象江伯在城市主要街道上巡游，结果阻碍了交通。尽管吉米同意立即离开，但江伯拒绝移动，最终需要15名警察合力将其推离街道。文章通过这个幽默的故事，展示了情态动词的多种用法，包括should have done（原本应该做而没做）、ought to have done（应该做而没做）等，以及多个与交通和警察相关的词汇和短语。",

      "Last Christmas, the circus owner, Jimmy Gates, decided to take some presents to a children's hospital.",
      "Dressed up as Father Christmas and accompanied by a 'guard of honour' of six pretty girls, he set off down the main street of the city riding a baby elephant called Jumbo.",
      "He should have known that the police would never allow this sort of thing.",
      "A policeman approached Jimmy and told him he ought to have gone along a side street as Jumbo was holding up the traffic.",
      "Though Jimmy agreed to go at once, Jumbo refused to move.",
      "Fifteen policemen had to push very hard to get him off the main street.",
      "The police had a difficult time, but they were most amused.",
      "'Jumbo must weigh a few tons,' said a policeman afterwards, 'so it was fortunate that we didn't have to carry him.",
      "Of course, we should arrest him, but as he has a good record, we shall let him off this time.'"
